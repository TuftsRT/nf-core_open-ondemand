# nf-core bioinformatics pipelines on Open OnDemand

As the demand for reproducibility in bioinformatics analysis increases, workflow managers have become a crucial technology. Although nf-core provides many bioinformatics pipelines that are ready to use, they are not easily accessible to non-computational users. By integrating nf-core pipelines into the user-friendly OOD web interface, the process of executing them is significantly simplified. This enables users with limited programming experience to utilize best practices for bioinformatics analysis without navigating through the initial learning curve, thus making nexflow and nf-core more accessible to a wider audience. The scripts and OOD apps for nf-core pipelines shared in this repository will enable other HPC centers to easily deploy nf-core bioinformatics pipelines on their OOD platforms.
